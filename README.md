## Description
(Work in Progress)
 The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
To complete the assignment, youâ€™ll need to do the following:
Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

## Installation
In the integrated terminal, install the dependencies using, npm i.

## Usage
After installing still in the integrated terminal, start the application using, npm start.
